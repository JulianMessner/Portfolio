        <h2 id="m2427">Relevant Legal Bases</h2>
        <p><strong>Relevant legal bases according to the GDPR:</strong> Below, you will find an overview of the legal
            bases
            of the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that, in addition to the provisions of the GDPR,
            national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or business. If more
            specific
            legal bases are relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection
            declaration.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given consent to the processing of
                their
                personal data for one or more specific purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Contractual performance and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR)</strong> - Processing
                is
                necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for the
                implementation
                of pre-contractual measures requested by the data subject.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for the purposes of
                the
                legitimate interests pursued by the controller or a third party, except where such interests are
                overridden
                by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject requiring the protection of
                personal
                data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>National data protection regulations in Austria:</strong> In addition to the GDPR, there are national
            data protection regulations in Austria. This includes, in particular, the Federal Act for the Protection of
            Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data (Data Protection Act - DSG). The Data Protection
            Act
            contains specific regulations, especially regarding the right to information, the right to correction or
            deletion, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, and
            transmission, as well as automated decision-making in individual cases.</p>

        <h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2>
        <p>In accordance with legal requirements, we implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, taking
            into account the state of the art, implementation costs, the nature, scope, circumstances, and purposes of
            processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
            persons. These measures include securing the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by
            controlling
            physical and electronic access to the data, as well as the access, input, transmission, availability, and
            separation of data. We have also established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subject rights, the
            deletion of data, and responses to data threats. Additionally, we consider data protection during the
            development or selection of hardware, software, and procedures, following the principle of data protection
            by
            design and by default.</p>
        <p>TLS/SSL encryption (https): To protect user data transmitted through our online services, we use TLS/SSL
            encryption. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is the standard technology for securing internet connections by
            encrypting data transmitted between a website or app and a browser (or between two servers). Transport Layer
            Security (TLS) is an updated and more secure version of SSL. Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is
            displayed in the URL when a website is secured by an SSL/TLS certificate.</p>

        <h2 id="m25">Transmission of Personal Data</h2>
        <p>As part of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the data is transmitted or disclosed to other
            entities, companies, legally independent organizational units, or individuals. Recipients of this data may
            include service providers or providers of services and content integrated into a website, especially those
            with
            IT tasks. In such cases, we comply with legal requirements and conclude appropriate contracts or agreements
            that
            serve to protect your data with the recipients of your data.</p>

        <h2 id="m24">International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Data processing in third countries: If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union
            (EU)
            or the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if processing takes place in connection with the use of services
            from
            third parties or the disclosure or transmission of data to other persons, entities, or companies, this only
            occurs in compliance with legal requirements. If the level of data protection in the third country has been
            recognized by an adequacy decision (Art. 45 GDPR), this decision serves as the basis for the data transfer.
            Otherwise, data transfers only take place if the level of data protection is otherwise ensured, particularly
            through standard contractual clauses (Art. 46(2)(c) GDPR), explicit consent, or in the case of contractual
            or
            legally required transmission (Art. 49(1) GDPR). In addition, we will inform you of the basis for the
            transfer
            to third countries with each provider from the third country, with adequacy decisions taking precedence as
            the
            basis. Information on third-country transfers and existing adequacy decisions can be found in the
            information
            provided by the EU Commission: <a
                href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=de"
                target="_blank">https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=de.</a>
        </p>
        <p>EU-US Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework: Within the framework of the "Data Privacy Framework" (DPF), the
            EU
            Commission has also recognized the level of data protection as safe for certain companies from the USA under
            the
            adequacy decision of July 10, 2023. The list of certified companies and further information on the DPF can
            be
            found on the website of the US Department of Commerce at <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/"
                target="_blank">https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/</a> (in English). We will inform you in the
            context of
            the data protection notices which service providers certified under the Data Privacy Framework we use.</p>

        <h2 id="m12">Deletion of Data</h2>
        <p>We delete the data we process in accordance with legal requirements as soon as the consents granted for
            processing are revoked or other permissions are no longer valid (e.g., when the purpose of processing this
            data
            has ceased to exist or it is not required for the purpose). If the data is not deleted because it is
            necessary
            for other and legally permissible purposes, its processing is limited to these purposes. This applies, for
            example, to data that must be retained for commercial or tax reasons or whose storage is necessary for
            asserting, exercising, or defending legal claims or protecting the rights of another natural or legal
            person.
            Our data protection notices may also contain further information on the storage and deletion of data that
            primarily applies to the respective processing.</p>

        <h2 id="m10">Rights of Data Subjects</h2>
        <p>Rights of data subjects under the GDPR: You, as data subjects, have various rights under the GDPR,
            particularly
            arising from Art. 15 to 21 GDPR:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to object:</strong> You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your
                particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you which is based on Art. 6(1)(e)
                or
                (f) GDPR, including profiling based on those provisions. If the personal data concerning you is
                processed
                for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any

                time to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purpose of such marketing; this also
                applies
                to profiling insofar as it is related to such direct marketing.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to withdraw consent:</strong> You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Right to information:</strong> You have the right to request confirmation as to whether personal
                data concerning you is being processed and, if so, to obtain information about this data and further
                details
                according to legal requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to rectification:</strong> You have the right to request the completion of personal data
                concerning you or the correction of inaccurate data concerning you according to legal requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to erasure and restriction of processing:</strong> You have the right, in accordance with
                legal requirements, to request the immediate erasure of personal data concerning you or, alternatively,
                the
                restriction of processing of the data.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to data portability:</strong> You have the right to receive the personal data concerning
                you,
                which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format or to request
                the
                transmission of this data to another controller according to legal requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Complaint to supervisory authority:</strong> Without prejudice to any other administrative or
                judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, particularly in
                the
                Member State of your habitual residence, place of work, or the place of the alleged infringement, if you
                believe that the processing of personal data concerning you violates the provisions of the GDPR.</li>
        </ul>
       


        <h2 id="m134">Use of Cookies</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small text files or other storage markers that store information on devices and retrieve
            information
            from devices. For example, to store login status in a user account, shopping cart content in an e-shop,
            viewed
            content, or used functions of an online offering. Cookies can also be used for various purposes, such as
            functionality, security, and comfort of online offerings, as well as creating analyses of visitor flows.</p>
        <p><strong>Consent Information:</strong> We use cookies in accordance with legal requirements. Therefore, we
            obtain
            prior consent from users, unless legally not required. Consent is not necessary, in particular, when storing
            and
            retrieving information, including cookies, is absolutely necessary to provide users with an explicitly
            requested
            telemedia service (i.e., our online offering). Typically, essential cookies include cookies with functions
            related to the display and functionality of the online offering, load balancing, security, storage of user
            preferences, and choices or similar purposes related to providing the main and ancillary functions of the
            online
            offering requested by users. Revocable consent is clearly communicated to users and includes information
            about
            the specific use of cookies.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Protection Legal Bases:</strong> The legal basis for processing users' personal data using
            cookies
            depends on whether we ask users for consent. If users consent, the legal basis for processing their data is
            the
            declared consent. Otherwise, data processed using cookies is based on our legitimate interests (e.g., in the
            economic operation of our online offering and improving its usability) or, if the use of cookies is
            necessary to
            fulfill our contractual obligations, on the basis of the contract. We provide information about the purposes
            for
            which we process cookies during this data protection declaration or as part of our consent and processing
            processes.</p>
        <p><strong>Storage Duration:</strong> Regarding the storage duration, the following types of cookies are
            distinguished:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Temporary Cookies (also: Session or Session Cookies):</strong> Temporary cookies are deleted at
                the
                latest after a user leaves an online offering and closes their device (e.g., browser or mobile
                application).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Permanent Cookies:</strong> Permanent cookies remain stored even after the device is closed. For
                example, login status can be saved, or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user
                revisits a
                website. Additionally, data collected using cookies can be used for audience measurement. If we do not
                provide explicit information about the type and duration of cookies (e.g., as part of obtaining
                consent),
                users should assume that cookies are permanent and may have a storage duration of up to two years.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>General Information on Revocation and Objection (Opt-Out):</strong> Users can revoke their consent at
            any
            time and object to processing in accordance with legal requirements. Users can restrict the use of cookies
            in
            their browser settings (which may also limit the functionality of our online offering). An objection to the
            use
            of cookies for online marketing purposes can also be declared on the websites <a

        <p><strong>Additional Information on Processing Processes, Procedures, and Services:</strong></p>
        <ul class="m-elements">
            <li><strong>Processing of Cookie Data Based on Consent:</strong> We use a consent management solution to
                obtain,
                log, manage, and revoke user consent for the use of cookies or procedures and providers mentioned in the
                consent management solution. This process is used to obtain, log, manage, and revoke consents,
                particularly
                regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies used to store, retrieve, and process information
                on
                users' devices. Within this process, user consents for the use of cookies and related information
                processing, including specific processing and providers mentioned in the consent management process, are
                obtained. Users also have the option to manage and revoke their consents. Consent declarations are
                stored to
                avoid repeated queries and to provide evidence of consent in accordance with legal requirements. Storage
                is
                done server-side and/or in a cookie (so-called opt-in cookie) or using similar technologies to associate
                consent with a specific user or their device. If there are no specific indications about the providers
                of
                consent management services, the following general information applies: The storage duration of consent
                is
                up to two years. A pseudonymous user identifier is created, which is stored together with the time of
                consent, details about the scope of consent (e.g., relevant categories of cookies and/or service
                providers),
                and information about the browser, system, and device used; <span class=""><strong>Legal Bases:</strong>

        <h2 id="m225">Provision of the Online Offering and Web Hosting</h2>
        <p>We process user data to provide them with our online services. For this purpose, we process the user's IP

                browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page), and
                usually IP addresses and the requesting provider. Server log files can be used, on the one hand, for
                security purposes, e.g., to avoid overloading servers (especially in the

                case of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks), and on the other hand, to ensure the load and
